### :pencil: Tasks

Try playing around with the 12-Hour and 24-Hour button shown on the screen, the purpose of these two functions is to change the number of entries (weather data) shown on your screen. So if you click the 12-Hour button, the screen should only show you the weather for the next 12-Hour. Did anything happen after you clicked the buttons? 

<details><summary> Did your screen change in any ways?  </summary>
<p>
It did not right? But, that is the anticipated result. Do you know why it is not working? What do you need to do to make update the results on the screen
</p>
</details>

</br>
Can you see what type of data are being returned by the Weather API? What do you need to do to see the response body that describes the weather? What variable contains this data? 
</br>
Once you find it, you can do so much with it. For example, you can display data regarding timezone, humidity level, pressure, wind speed, etc. You have the ability to display any output you want onto your screen.
