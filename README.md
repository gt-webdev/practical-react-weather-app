## Practical React -  Weather App Activity

### :atom_symbol: Introduction 
This code repository contains the starter code for the coding portion of our *Practical React Workshop* (Spring 2023). Here, the following concepts in React will be used to implement a basic weather application:
* JSX
* Components
* State
* Conditional Rendering
* Rendering Lists
* Hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) 

You can refer to our [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gEppHNplM2Ox5mp3CvtPqkk8cDMq8v6YwbXSFWTdI80/edit?usp=sharing) if you are unsure about any of these concepts.
